    This project focuses on developing a RFID board capable of
    reading, writing, and emulating RFID cards at both 125 kHz
    and 13.56 MHz frequencies. The board is powered by the RP2040
    microcontroller, utilizing the PN532 for HF RFID operations
    and a custom analog circuit for LF RFID handling. The firmware
    is based on FreeRTOS, ensuring efficient multitasking and
    real-time performance.
